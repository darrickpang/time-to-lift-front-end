## How the idea came about
We see a lot of apps that people use to keep track of their workouts like running, swimming, or biking. Such examples are Garmin, Fitbit, and Apple. However, these apps do not have one that allows us to connect with coaches and other users to schedule workouts with themselves and choose a class from a coach. So, my idea was to design an app that could do that, in addition of keeping track of their workouts.

## Technologies
The technologies that I used are Rails as a backend with HTML/CSS/React frontend, and a Google API key for their map. 

# Instructions
To run the app, follow these instructions: 
1. In another terminal, $ cd /time-to-lift-back-end
2. $ bundle install
3. $ rails s --> to run Rails API server
4. $ cd /time-to-lift-front-end
5. $ npm install
6. $ npm start
Now you should see the signup/login page. 

# Welcome Page
On this page, you can see a sign-up/sign-in for both coaches and students.

# Student
First, sign-up or sign-in as a student. In the page, you can see a calendar, add a schedule to it, and a way to sign up for classes coaches made. 

## Sign up for classes
Students can see all classes that shows the date, time, duration and coach's name. Students can choose and sign up for a class.

## Schedule
Here, the student can make a schedule and submit the data that will add to the calendar. Students can also see events on their calendar. 

## Friends 
Students can also send and receive friend requests from other students. They can see their friends list too.

# Coach
For coaches, they need to sign-up or sign-in. Once, in they see a map and calendar. 

## Map
The purpose of Google Maps is to show the locations of gyms near their current location. 

## Gym
The coach can pick a gym and add it to a list of gyms by submitting its information. 

## Calendar
The calendar is there for the coach so that once a class is created, it will show up on the calendar. Students then will be able to see it and sign up for the class. If a student signed up for a class, they should be able to see the students' names. 

# Acknowlegements
I wish to thank my coach and fellow classmates for being helpful in making this project. I want to give special thanks to all my classmates for working with them the past 12 weeks and being helpful, being great people and welcoming me with open arms into their June 1, 2020 class because I was rolled back from my April 20 class. Finally, I want to thank all the instructors  and coaches at Flatiron School for teaching us the tools we need to succeed.
